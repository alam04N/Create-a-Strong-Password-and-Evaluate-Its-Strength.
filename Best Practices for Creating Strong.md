## **Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords--**



1. #### Use a mixture of characters:



* ###### Uppercase (A-Z), lowercase (a-z), numbers (0-9), and symbols (e.g., !, $, #) increase complexity.





#### 2\. Increase password length:



* ###### A password with 12–16 characters is recommended. Longer is even better.





#### 3\. Avoid common words or predictable patterns:



* ###### Avoid using dictionary words (e.g., "apple") or easily guessable combinations (e.g., "12345").





#### 4\. Randomness is key:



* ###### Random strings of characters (like D$7vZ#2f@Lw8gKj) are much stronger than something based on personal info.





#### 5\. Use a password manager:



* ###### Since remembering complex passwords can be hard, use a password manager to securely store and generate them.





#### 6\. Don’t reuse passwords:



* ###### Each account should have a unique password to reduce the risk if one account is compromised.





#### 7\. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):



* ###### Where possible, use 2FA for an extra layer of security, even if your password is compromised.
