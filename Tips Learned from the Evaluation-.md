### **Tips Learned from the Evaluation:-**





###### Complexity is critical:- A password with a good mix of uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers scores much better than a simple password.





###### Length is a major factor:-  Longer passwords increase entropy, making it harder to break using brute-force.



###### 

###### Predictability hurts:-  Passwords like "password123" are easily guessed by attackers using dictionary or brute-force methods.



###### 

###### Password managers are useful:- You can generate long, random, complex passwords without the burden of remembering them all.
